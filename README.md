# HouseParty

A web application that utilizes Django + SQLite database on the backend and React on the frontend. The application itself is a music controller where users can create and join rooms where they can play/pause songs or vote to skip them.

The program relies on the Spotify API to play music.

This project was based on this YouTube tutorial https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kCLWnGmK0jUBmGLaJxvi4j and the code was not written by me.
